# Instagram Clone 
 
Hello! This is a clone of the popular social media website "Instagram" that I built while following a tutorial by Sonny Sangha üòÅ

## Features

* Home Page to view posts by others and from fake data taken from Faker.io
* Login capabilities using Gmail (using NextAuth and Firebase v9)
* Once logged in, users can post pictures with captions (user gmail information stored and used as username and profile image)
* When logged in, also able to comment and like other posts
* Header at top used to traverse website
* Once logged out, all data is saved (posts, likes, comments) on Firebase and can be viewed 

## Architecture
This app was built with React.JS, Next.JS, HTML, Tailwind CSS, Firebase v9, NextAuth, Recoil, Faker.io and hosted on Hostinger and Vercel. As with most React Apps, Instaclone was built on the premise of reusable "components". This means that each component (Header, Posts, Fake Posts, Feed, Stories, Sugegstions, and Modal) are all individual parts of the app that can be used over and over again. 

This app also uses Recoil to track whether or not the user is logged in (via their gmail). Depending on login status, the page changes thus allowing or prohibiting the users' ability to post pictures/comments/likes. 

Lastly, the login functionality is handled by NextAuth (which is hosted by Google on Firebase v9). All login functionality is hosted on the login page and pushed through Google authentication.
